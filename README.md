# pokeapi

## Description
This is a front-end project based in a Danki Code course, the objective here is to learn how to handle an API.
This first version of the site is pretty basic and as I get better at Front-End I will improve it.

## Update
I practiced handling an API in order to create a card that shows the name, id and items of a pokemon, it was a nice study since I was able to enhance my skills with APIs
